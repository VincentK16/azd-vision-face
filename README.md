# Azure AI Vision Project

This repository contains code designed to faciliate your experimentation and exploration with the Azure AI Vision service. 

Azure AI services help developers and organizations to rapidly create intelligent, cutting-edge, market-ready, and responsible applications with out-of-the-box and pre-built and customizable APIs and models. Example applications include natural language processing (NLP) for conversations, search, monitoring, translation, speech, vision, and decision-making.

Most Azure AI services are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages. For more information, see each service's documentation.
